# Taxi-Web-App
Project taken from Loftschool's React course. Addresses are being fetched from the school's server aswell as map routes. Supports mobile version. Still a work in progress.

Server has some kind of delay. If you've done the registration process, its gonna take 5 to 10 mins for you to be able to login with that registration data.

Test logs:
- email: 'email@example.com'
- password: 'password'

Tech stack: React Router 6, Redux Toolkit, Formik, Material UI.
